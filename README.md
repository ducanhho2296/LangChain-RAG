# LangChain-RAG Experiments and Embedding Model Testing

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

In this project, we:

Experiment with different embedding models via API calls using LangChain.

Create and manage LLM agents for retrieval tasks.

Test vector databases for efficient storage and querying.

Build, refine, and benchmark a custom RAG pipeline.

This repository serves as a playground for testing and evaluating the performance of RAG systems under various conditions and configurations.

ðŸš€ Key Features

Embedding Model Testing: Evaluate performance of different embedding models using APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere).

Agent Creation: Build custom agents with LangChain for intelligent querying and response generation.

Vector Database Integration: Experiment with ChromaDB, FAISS, Pinecone, and Milvus.

Dynamic RAG Pipelines: Implement RAG pipelines with different configurations to handle unstructured data retrieval and response generation.

Benchmarking and Analysis: Compare accuracy, retrieval speed, and resource usage across various setups.
